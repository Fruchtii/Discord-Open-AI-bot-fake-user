# Discord OpenAI Bot

This Discord bot uses OpenAI's API to generate human-like responses in chat conversations.

## Features

- Responds to messages in a human-like manner
- Uses OpenAI's GPT model for generating responses
- Easy to set up and customize

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a `config.json` file with your Discord bot token and OpenAI API key
4. Run the bot: `python bot.py`

## Configuration

Create a `config.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:

```json
{
  "discord_token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
  "openai_api_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
}
```

Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual tokens.

## Usage

The bot will respond to messages in channels it has access to. It uses OpenAI's API to generate human-like responses based on the conversation context.

## Deployment on DigitalOcean

To deploy this bot on DigitalOcean, follow these steps:

1. Create a DigitalOcean account if you don't have one.

2. Create a new Droplet:
   - Choose an image: Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64
   - Choose a plan: Basic (cheapest option should be sufficient)
   - Choose a datacenter region close to your target audience
   - Add your SSH key or create a new one

3. Once your Droplet is created, SSH into it:
   ```
   ssh root@your_droplet_ip
   ```

4. Update the system and install required packages:
   ```
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv git -y
   ```

5. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/discord-openai-bot.git
   cd discord-openai-bot
   ```

6. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

7. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

8. Create the `config.json` file and add your Discord token and OpenAI API key:
   ```
   nano config.json
   ```
   Paste your configuration and save the file (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

9. Install screen to run the bot in the background:
   ```
   sudo apt install screen -y
   ```

10. Start a new screen session and run the bot:
    ```
    screen -S discord-bot
    python bot.py
    ```

11. Detach from the screen session by pressing Ctrl+A, then D.

Your bot should now be running on the DigitalOcean Droplet. To reattach to the screen session later, use:
```
screen -r discord-bot
```

To keep your bot running after you close the SSH connection, make sure to detach from the screen session instead of closing it.

This updated README.md now includes a detailed section on how to deploy the bot on DigitalOcean. It covers creating a Droplet, setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the bot using screen to keep it active in the background.

Remember to replace `your_username` in the git clone URL with your actual GitHub username when you create the repository.
